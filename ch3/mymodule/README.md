# mymodule examples

This contains the mymodule example with various Views module plugins.

It will install a `pricing` database with sample values for the custom field plugins. There is an example View in `config/install` that will be enabled when this module is installed. You can see the view display by going to `/pricing-data-example` after `mymodule` is installed.

It also includes an aggregate view example available at `/aggregate-report-example`.
