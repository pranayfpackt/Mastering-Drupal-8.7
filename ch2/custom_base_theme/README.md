# Custom base theme.

This is an example of a theme which defines `base theme: false`.

When this theme is installed, the Stable theme will _not_ be installed or used as its base theme. Instead all of the default CSS files and Twig templates provided by modules will be loaded.

A base theme like this would be required to provide template overrides and library extensions or overrides.
